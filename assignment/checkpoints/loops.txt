# 1 - Describe the benefit(s) of using loops in your code.
Loops allow you to repeat the same set of instructions until a certain
condition is met or until you tell it to stop.  This is useful because
it allows us to control different scopes of the program based on
data that is presented and interpolated.
# 2 - What kind of loop would you want to use if you wanted to do something a certain number of times: for or while?
for(){}
# 3 - What kind of loop would you want to use if you wanted to do something as long as a condition were true: for or while?
while(){}
# 4 - What is wrong with the argument of this for loop: `for(i = 0; i < array.length; i++)`?
'i' will always be less the array.length because it is 0, creating an infinite loop and the system
will be unable to process this.
# 5 - What does it mean if you get a console error like this: "Uncaught ReferenceError: i is not defined"?
The variable needs to be declared.  The stack can't process an undeclared variable which is asked to do
something, and will produce an error letting you know that 'i' is undefined or -> undeclared.
